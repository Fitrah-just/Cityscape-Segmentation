A self-driving car, or autonomous car, is a vehicle capable of moving without human intervention. These vehicles utilize advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras, lidar, radar, and data processing systems to detect their environment, make decisions, and control the vehicle's movements.

# Segmentation
Segmentation in the context of computer vision and image processing is the process of grouping pixels or objects into more defined parts. This helps identify and understand structures in an image, separate objects from the background, and facilitate further analysis.
